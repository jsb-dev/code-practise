Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Reverse Integer: Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Palindrome Number: Check if a number is a palindrome. A palindrome number 
is the same forward and backward.

Roman to Integer: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.

Longest Common Prefix: Write a function to find the longest common prefix 
string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an 
empty string.

Valid Parentheses: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}',
'[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if 
open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets, and open brackets are 
closed in the correct order.

Merge Sorted Array: Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 
into nums1 as one sorted array.

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Given a sorted array nums, remove the 
duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new 
length.

Remove Element: Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that 
value in-place and return the new length.

Implement strStr(): Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack,
or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Search Insert Position: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target 
value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where 
it would be if it were inserted in order.

Maximum Subarray: Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) 
which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Length of Last Word: Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some 
number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

Plus One: Given a non-empty array of decimal digits representing a non-negative 
integer, increment one to the integer. The digits are stored such that the most 
significant digit is at the head of the list.

Add Binary: Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
